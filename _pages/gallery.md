Welcome to my personal page! As an electrical engineer with a deep fascination for space, I enjoy exploring the world around me. My hobbies include traveling, hiking, photography, running, and more recently, lead climbing.
Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I also enjoy documenting the journey of building a research lab—from the early days of installing optical tables and assembling instrumentation to group hikes and community activities such as our Chautauqua hike and other lab outings. Many of the photos featured here were taken by members of the lab and reflect the collaborative spirit and shared experiences that have shaped the group since its inception.

In addition to research and lab life, I have a couple of fun creative milestones to share:
<ul>
<li>My first art exhibit, <a href="https://champaignparks.com/event/the-world-through-my-lens-by-yamuna-phal/2018-10-12/" target = _blank>The World Through My Lens</a></li>
<li>My National Geographic Traveller article on the Northern Lights, <a href="https://www.bootsnall.com/articles/seeing-the-northern-lights-lofoten-islands-norway.html" target = _blank>Seeing the Northern Lights: It's not as Easy as Driving North and Looking Up</a></li>
</ul>

Below are some places I have traveled, along with highlights from lab activities and adventures. A broader collection of my favorite photographs from around the world can be found on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/126646754@N04/" target = _blank>flickr</a>.
