    summary: Our project, the Mid-InfraRed AdvanCed Life-detection Explorer (MIRACLE), is part of NASA’s PICASSO program. We are developing a mid-infrared imager with space flight capability, a technology that could uncover prebiotic chemistry and provide critical insights into the evolutionary dynamics of potentially habitable planetary bodies.
