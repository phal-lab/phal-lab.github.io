I am excited to begin my journey as an Assistant Professor at the Colorado School of Mines in the Department of Electrical Engineering starting this Fall. I am actively seeking motivated graduate students to join my research team. If you have a passion for interdisciplinary research that merges engineering, optics, and data science to advance biomedical applications, please feel free to reach out at yphal [at] mines [dot] edu! 

Before pursuing my doctorate in Electrical Engineering at UIUC, I gained industry experience as an analog design engineer at Finisar and the Swedish Institute of Space Physics. My earlier research centered on developing instrumentation for space applications, and now, I am focusing on the creation of optical tools for diagnostic purposes.
