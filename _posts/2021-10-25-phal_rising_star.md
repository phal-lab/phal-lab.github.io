Yamuna Phal presented “Emerging Techniques in Infrared Imaging” at the 2021 MIT EECS Rising Stars Workshop designed to recognize and empower students with underrepresented gender identities in the STEM fields. Her research, “encompasses a fundamental information theory approach that pushes the spatial and spectral limits of IR microscopy”. This workshop helps highlight the work of historically marginalized and underrepresented genders in the electrical engineering and computer science fields.

Phal’s research in Beckman’s Computational Imaging Group advances infrared imaging technology for better, faster disease diagnosis. Her presentation, titled “<a href="https://risingstars21-eecs.mit.edu/phal/" target="_blank">Emerging Techniques in Infrared Imaging</a>,” expounded on this groundbreaking work.
